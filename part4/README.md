## Part 4 - Simple Web Client

In this phase, youâ€™ll focus on the front-end development of your application using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript ES6**. Your task is to design and implement an interactive user interface that connects with the back-end services developed in previous parts of the project.

## Objectives

- Develop a user-friendly interface following provided design specifications.
- Implement client-side functionality to interact with the back-end API.
- Ensure secure and efficient data handling using JavaScript.
- Apply modern web development practices to create a dynamic web application.

---

## Learning Goals

- Understand and apply **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript ES6** in a real-world project.
- Learn to interact with back-end services using **AJAX/Fetch API**.
- Implement authentication mechanisms and manage user sessions.
- Use client-side scripting to enhance user experience without page reloads.

## Important Note

When testing your client against your API, you may encounter a **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** error. To resolve this, modify your API code to allow your client to fetch data from the API. Refer to [this article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) for a deeper understanding of CORS and how to configure your Flask API.
